# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mickael

I started to learn how to code just for fun and fell in love with it!

I am a passionate software developer with 3+ years of experience and since I started my professional career I have had the opportunity to contribute to many projects creating front-end, back-end, and (sometimes) mobile features.

The leading technologies I have experience using are #Vue, #React, and #Node.js with #Typescript and #Javascript.
